# download sites:
# FOR PostgreSQL windows binaries
# - https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries
# - Note: need web scraping to extract the latest version.
# FOR PostGIS binraries, that include pgrouting, pgpointcloud
# http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/$PG_RELEASE/  where $PG_RELEASE something like pg14
# - Note: Better to use web scraping to extract the latest version that match the PostgreSQL Major number version
# FOR experimental build https://winnie.postgis.net/download/windows/pg14/buildbot/
